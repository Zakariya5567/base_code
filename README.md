## Extension
The feature named Extension methods, Introduced in Dart 2.7 allows us to add new functionality
to already available libraries. Although it does not allow us to modify existing code directly, 
It gives us the ability to customize a class in a way that we can read and use it easily.

## Widget extension
1 .center 
2 .align
3 .expanded
4 .onPress
5 .rotate
6 .positioned

e.g  Text("Hello").center

## int extension

=> A SizedBox for create space
1 .height
2 .width

e.g  20.height, 20.width

=> A give height and width to Widget
1 .h
2 .w

e.g  Container(20.h, 20.w)


## String extension

=> After String user .toText() it will convert to Text Widget
e.g    "Hello world".toText()


## Object extension
